        <h1>A Few Other Things</h1>
        <h2>What I Do for Fun</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I indulge in a variety of activities like riding my bike, working on it, cooking, drawing, going for walks, spending time with people, creating things, and reading. Recently, I picked up Texas Hold â€˜Em and have been thoroughly enjoying refining my game.</p>
    
        <h2>My Dream in IT</h2>
        <p>My aspiration is to establish and run my own IT consulting business, combining my skills and passion to make a meaningful impact.</p>
    
        <h2>My Roots</h2>
        <p>Originally from the Deep South, I've lived in Louisiana, Georgia, and North Carolina. Falling in love with Massachusetts during my undergraduate years, I returned to Boston for my current pursuits after completing my Masters in Information Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While I miss the flavors of good barbecue, fried green tomatoes, and early springs, I cherish the character and attitude of my current home.</p>
